# Conjoint-Analysis-to-find-optimal-pricing-and-features

The narrative on what is conjoint analysis, how it works, and its benefits.

Conjoint analysis helps us understand our market prior to launching a new product. By running a study and asking a sample of our market to holistically rank different products in the same category, and categorizing the products’ features, we can extract how our market values different features.
Based on that feature importance analysis, we can then benchmark our product against the existing products. To do so successfully, we assign partworth coefficients, which conceptually represent how important a feature in the product is and therefore how it could sway the customer to buy ours over another one. The exception to this rule is the price partworth coefficient. This shows price sensitivity, so depending on the product category and the results of our study, higher prices might reduce our projected market share greatly if our customers are shown to be very price sensitive.

After having this information on what our customer values, and what quantitative utility they can get from our competitors, we can consider which features we want to prioritize in our design. Finally we can run a price sensitivity analysis, and use our projected market share and calculate which profit we expect based on different price points. This helps determine which optimal price we should choose to maximize our profit.

The benefits of conjoint analysis include being able to design iterations of a product and getting a prediction on how profitable they would be without the need for extensive prototyping. In general, conjoint analysis allows companies to do a rough forecast on sales without even needing to produce the product. Lastly, it also helps in quantifying what customers value - assessing the utility a customer gets out of a certain set of product features can assist product analysts in the trade-off analysis they conduct during product design. In other words, including the most valuable features that will draw customers to purchase and forgoing features that are less valuable per the market study, all while keeping an attractive price.

Partworth for price is negative across all team members. This suggests that a market preference declines as the product's price increases, which aligns with general expectation.
The team's preferences can be categorized based on screen size. All members show the least preference for the 65-inch model. For the 75 and 85-inch models, Ian, Amber, and Colin favor the 85-inch size over other features, while Yuna and Jihyun prioritize high resolution. From this feature importance analysis, it is evident that in the first market, which values larger screens, a design incorporating an 85-inch screen with high resolution yields the highest potential profits. Conversely, in the second market, where high resolution is more valued than screen size, a 75-inch screen with high resolution emerges as the most profitable design.
