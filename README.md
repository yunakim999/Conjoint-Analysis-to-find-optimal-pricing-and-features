# Conjoint-Analysis-to-find-optimal-pricing-and-features

The narrative on what is conjoint analysis, how it works, and its benefits.
Conjoint analysis helps us understand our market prior to launching a new product. By running a study and asking a sample of our market to holistically rank different products in the same category, and categorizing the products’ features, we can extract how our market values different features.
Based on that feature importance analysis, we can then benchmark our product against the existing products. To do so successfully, we assign partworth coefficients, which conceptually represent how important a feature in the product is and therefore how it could sway the customer to buy ours over another one. The exception to this rule is the price partworth coefficient. This shows price sensitivity, so depending on the product category and the results of our study, higher prices might reduce our projected market share greatly if our customers are shown to be very price sensitive.
After having this information on what our customer values, and what quantitative utility they can get from our competitors, we can consider which features we want to prioritize in our design. Finally we can run a price sensitivity analysis, and use our projected market share and calculate which profit we expect based on different price points. This helps determine which optimal price we should choose to maximize our profit.
The benefits of conjoint analysis include being able to design iterations of a product and getting a prediction on how profitable they would be without the need for extensive prototyping. In general, conjoint analysis allows companies to do a rough forecast on sales without even needing to produce the product. Lastly, it also helps in quantifying what customers value - assessing the utility a customer gets out of a certain set of product features can assist product analysts in the trade-off analysis they conduct during product design. In other words, including the most valuable features that will draw customers to purchase and forgoing features that are less valuable per the market study, all while keeping an attractive price.
